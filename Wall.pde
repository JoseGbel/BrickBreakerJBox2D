/**********************

The idea for this class in the future is to implement methods for location awareness. For example if the ball Hits any brick in the wall
whereever its position, there will be methods that returns the position of the last element in the brickÂ´s row. 

Future updates will display circular arc shaped walls rotating around the screen.
